//! Shared between the phone resolver and the giga backend.

//! Everything here is service-agnostic: the provider extractors, the HTTP
//! clients they go out through, the resolve cache, and the CORS and rate-limit
//! policy.

//! It lives in one crate so the 13 extractors exist in exactly one place.
//! Providers change their markup often; two copies would drift, and the copy
//! that wasn't being looked at would be the one that broke.
