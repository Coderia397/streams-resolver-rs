# Deploying to the phone

The resolver runs on an Android phone under Termux. It is a single static
aarch64 binary — no Node, no `node_modules`, nothing to install at deploy time.

## Once, per device

**1. Termux and Termux:Boot** — from F-Droid, not Play Store. The Play version
is stale and its boot add-on doesn't work.

**2. Packages**

```sh
pkg install cloudflared termux-api
termux-wake-lock
```

**3. Battery** — Settings → Apps → Termux → Battery → **Unrestricted**, for
`com.termux`, `com.termux.api` and `com.termux.boot`. Without it Android kills
the resolver whenever the screen has been off a while.

**4. Phantom process killer** — Android 12+ kills apps that spawn many child
processes, which is exactly what three supervisor loops look like. From a
computer with the phone on USB:

```sh
adb shell "/system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647"
adb shell "settings put global settings_enable_monitor_phantom_procs false"
```

`device_config` values can reset on reboot; the `settings` one persists.

**5. Cloudflare tunnel**

```sh
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create streams-resolver
cloudflared tunnel route dns streams-resolver resolver.example.com
```

**6. Secrets**

```sh
cp streams-env.example ~/.streams-env
chmod 600 ~/.streams-env
# then edit it
```

**7. Boot script**

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.termux/boot
cp start-streams.sh ~/.termux/boot/start-streams.sh
chmod 700 ~/.termux/boot/start-streams.sh
```

Keep only this one file in `~/.termux/boot`. Termux:Boot runs **every** file in
that folder at boot, backups included: on the first phone five old copies
(`start-pstream.sh.bak`, `.node-era` ...) ran next to the current script, which
gave six tunnels, two resolvers racing for the port (only one of them had the
SubDL key), two updaters and two loops pulling the old Node repository every two
minutes (found and cleaned on 2026-10-25; the copies are in `~/boot-old`).
Keep settings in `~/.streams-env`, not inside a boot script.

The first phone predates the rename and still runs `start-pstream.sh`: binary
`~/pstream-resolver-rs`, tunnel `pstream-resolver`, settings `~/.pstream-env`,
release asset `pstream-resolver-aarch64` (the release publishes both names).

**8. First binary** — the updater only replaces an existing file, so seed it:

```sh
curl -fsSL -o ~/streams-resolver-rs \
  https://github.com/Coderia397/streams-resolver-rs/releases/latest/download/streams-resolver-aarch64
chmod 755 ~/streams-resolver-rs
sh ~/.termux/boot/start-streams.sh
```

## After that

Nothing. Push to `main`, CI publishes a new binary, the device swaps it in
within five minutes. No cable.

## Checking on it

```sh
tail -f ~/resolver.log     # the resolver
tail -f ~/tunnel.log       # cloudflared
tail -f ~/deploy.log       # updater: what it swapped and when
```

Three supervisors should be running, and both processes should have a parent
that is **not** PID 1 — a PPid of 1 means the supervisor died and nothing will
restart that process:

```sh
ps -A -o PID,PPID,NAME | grep -E 'streams-resolve|cloudflared'
```

## When it breaks

**Cloudflare 1033 / tunnel won't register.** `cloudflared` defaults to QUIC on
UDP 7844, which many public networks drop. The script already forces
`--protocol http2` (TCP). If it still fails, the network is blocking port 7844
on both protocols and no flag will help — use a different connection. Mobile
data usually works where cafe and library WiFi doesn't.

**Deploys stop arriving.** Check `~/deploy.log`. A checksum mismatch means a
truncated download, which the updater discards on purpose rather than
installing a corrupt binary.

**The resolver is up but the phone shows nothing.** That's normal — it has no
UI. Check `curl localhost:8790/`.

**Replacing the binary by hand fails with "Text file busy".** You cannot write
over a running executable. Write beside it and rename:

```sh
cat new-binary > ~/.res.new && chmod 755 ~/.res.new && mv ~/.res.new ~/streams-resolver-rs
pkill -x streams-resolve
```

Note `streams-resolve`, not the full name — Linux truncates process names to
15 characters, so `pkill -x streams-resolver-rs` matches nothing.
