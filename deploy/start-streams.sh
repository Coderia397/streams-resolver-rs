#   3. updater     — pulls a new binary from GitHub Releases and swaps it in
#
# Running this script twice starts a second set of everything. Three
# cloudflared instances fighting over one tunnel is not obvious from the
# outside, so the guard below refuses to start if a set is already running.

# one. That is satisfied the moment the file is written, so once it had
# swapped the file it could never again notice a problem. When a restart
# silently failed to take, the file was new, the process was old, and the
# updater stayed happy — it served a two-day-old build from a deleted inode
# while reporting itself up to date.
#
# Asking the running process for its version closes that hole: a swap that
# does not take is detected on the very next poll and retried.
